Most of these scripts are just little things Ive built to help something I had going on.

the ones that are in crontab are:

Stop_Seeders.sh #  
This is used to turn off completed transmission downloads if it finds any

Check_Media_Minidlna.sh #
     Sometimes the boot order gets out of whack depending on how long the disks take to get up and      running, this script checks minidlna for files, and if it doesnt see any, it restarts miniDLNA until it shows files
